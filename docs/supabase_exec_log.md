# Supabase Initialization Execution Log

## 2025-02-14
- Step: Connect to Supabase Postgres & execute `docs/supabase_init.sql`
  - Command: `python scripts/run_supabase_sql.py`
  - Result: ✗
  - Details: `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com" (198.18.3.59), port 6543 failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly`
  - Suggested action: Verify that the Supabase Postgres pooler allows connections from this host/IP, and confirm credentials. Retry once connectivity is confirmed.
- Retry: same command
  - Result: ✗
  - Details: `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com" (198.18.3.59), port 6543 failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly`
  - Suggested action: Contact Supabase to ensure the pooler is accessible or check network restrictions; retry after confirmation.
- Step: Connect to Supabase direct host & execute SQL (after updating MCP config)
  - Command: `PGHOST=db.lejhjsgalirpnbinbgcc.supabase.co PGPORT=5432 ... python scripts/run_supabase_sql.py`
  - Result: ✗
  - Details: `psycopg2.OperationalError: connection to server at "db.lejhjsgalirpnbinbgcc.supabase.co" (198.18.3.110), port 5432 failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly`
  - Suggested action: Confirm that external networking is allowed (IP allowlist / VPN) and credentials are valid for direct connection; check Supabase Project settings for “Direct Connection” enablement.
- Connectivity check: bare psycopg2 connect test (direct host)
  - Command: inline psycopg2 connect script
  - Result: ✗
  - Details: Same error (`server closed the connection unexpectedly` on port 5432).
  - Suggested action: Ensure project networking allows external connections and credentials are correct; consider testing via Supabase SQL editor or CLI to verify project state.
